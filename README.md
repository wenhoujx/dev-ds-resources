## FAQ

### What are high level job categories for SDE, their skill sets and their career path?

Categories:

- frontend FE: UI, mobile UI, workflow study, user experience(UX). FE sits closer to client and user than BE, so it requires more use case analysis.
- backend BE: data modeling, application layer, database, search engine, cache, message queue. In general, BE has more scopes than FE, but maybe less visibility, unless the stack is on fire.
- devops: setup infra to support dev and production, CI/CD, monitoring, alerting, logging, security.
- SRE: people who fights fires, bad WLB during on-call, but good pay and more vacations.

Language and skills:

- FE: javascript, typescripts, npm, node, vite, react, css, html.
- BE: java, C++, python are the major ones, though there are more langauge options than FE depending on the company, e.g. golang, scala, rust, etc.
- devops: python, bash, terraform, ansible, kubernetes, docker, aws, gcp, azure, etc.
- SRE: roughly same as devops.

career path: (the following content is highly opinionated and biased)

- FE: they are usually more social, i've seen many become product managers.
- BE: they are usually more technical, architects or managers are usual path.
- devops: same as BE
- SRE: managers, i rarely see an SRE become an architect.

### Should i put years of experience next to my language skills?

It's not necessary. You can use bold or highlight on skills you want to call out, or you can split to master proficincy or normal proficincy.

It's hard to count the YOE for a language, since you may first learned python in high school, use it on and off for 5 years, and used it intensely during your master research. Count the 5 years "gap" or not is personal choice.
