## FAQ

### Internal referral or online application?

Referral is usually better, [teamblind](https://www.teamblind.com/) has lots of people willing to refer you. They get the bonus if you get hired.
I found teamblind easier to get referral than cold reach out on linkedin.

Don't dismiss online application (or 海投), my personal experience is this is a numbers game, the more you apply, the more likely you will get an interview.

### Does intern or master degree count as working experience?

It depends on the company.

Some job description state it explicitly, e.g. "3 years of working experience or 1 year of working experience with a master degree".

My general rule is intern experience counts, and master degree counts as at least 2 year of working experience.

Don't be shy, apply that position and you will find out, there is nothing to lose other than time spent on that cover letter.

### What are project opportunities for students

It's hard to come up with a project on your own, you should find a team or a community.

- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), good for DS
- Meetup has local communities, go to bigger meetups, usually someone will pitch an idea, you can join the one you are interested in.
- School projects, lots of graduate program recruits graduate or undergraduate students to work on projects. Go talk to PHD students or professors, don't be shy.
- Open source, i don't think this has good ROI, rarely a graduate student can contribute to a project in a major way unless you are really into it. Reading their code is always learning and fun.
- github/Youtube resources, there are quality youtube walkthrough on how to build something.
  - [how to build x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
  - [projets to learn aws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06VgLTqNvU8)

### What are high level job categories for SDE, their skill sets and their career path?

Categories:

- frontend FE: UI, mobile UI, workflow study, user experience(UX). FE sits closer to client and user than BE, so it requires more use case analysis.
- backend BE: data modeling, application layer, database, search engine, cache, message queue. In general, BE has more scopes than FE, but maybe less visibility, unless the stack is on fire.
- devops: setup infra to support dev and production, CI/CD, monitoring, alerting, logging, security.
- SRE: people who fights fires, bad WLB during on-call, but good pay and more vacations.

Language and skills:

- FE: javascript, typescripts, npm, node, vite, react, css, html.
- BE: java, C++, python are the major ones, though there are more langauge options than FE depending on the company, e.g. golang, scala, rust, etc.
- devops: python, bash, terraform, ansible, kubernetes, docker, aws, gcp, azure, etc.
- SRE: roughly same as devops.

career path: (the following content is highly opinionated and biased)

- FE: they are usually more social, i've seen many become product managers.
- BE: they are usually more technical, architects or managers are usual path.
- devops: same as BE
- SRE: managers, i rarely see an SRE become an architect.

### Should i put years of experience next to my language skills?

It's not necessary. You can use bold or highlight on skills you want to call out, or you can split to master proficincy or normal proficincy.

It's hard to count the YOE for a language, since you may first learned python in high school, use it on and off for 5 years, and used it intensely during your master research. Count the 5 years "gap" or not is personal choice.
